  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: YOU NEED TO RESTART INTELLIJ IDEA NOW
================================================================================

Why? The Java installation you just did added environment variables, but
IntelliJ IDEA was already running, so it doesn't see the new Java yet.

WHAT TO DO NOW:
===============

1. CLOSE IntelliJ IDEA completely
   - File > Exit (or click the X button)
   - Make sure it's fully closed (check taskbar)

2. RESTART IntelliJ IDEA
   - Open it again
   - It will reload your Backend project

3. After IntelliJ reopens, follow these steps:


STEP 1: Configure Java in Project
==================================
Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S (opens Project Structure)
├── Click "Project" in left panel
├── SDK dropdown: Select your Java 11+ (should appear now!)
├── Language level: Select "11"
└── Click Apply & OK


STEP 2: Reload Maven to Download Dependencies
==============================================
View > Tool Windows > Maven (or click Maven tab on right)
├── Click the 🔄 Reload button (circular arrows, top-left)
├── Wait 2-5 minutes for downloads
└── Watch for "BUILD SUCCESS" message


STEP 3: Verify
==============
✅ pom.xml - no errors
✅ GiocatoriRestServlet.java - imports work
✅ Build > Build Project - succeeds


ALTERNATIVE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RESTART:
==========================================

You can manually reload Maven in IntelliJ without restarting:

1. File > Settings (Ctrl+Alt+S)
2. Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven > Runner
3. Set JRE: Click dropdown and select Java 11+
   (or click "..." and browse to: C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-XX)
4. Click OK
5. View > Tool Windows > Maven
6. Click 🔄 Reload All Maven Projects

This should work even without a restart!
